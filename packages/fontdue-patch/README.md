# Merkur fontdue patch

Merkur's pinned copy of [`fontdue`](https://crates.io/crates/fontdue) 0.9.4, applied through
the root workspace's `[patch.crates-io]`. **This is a modified copy of fontdue, not upstream
fontdue**, and it is redistributed under upstream's terms: MIT, Apache-2.0, or Zlib, whose
texts are the `LICENSE-*` files beside this README.

Merkur's modification: the crate retains validated immutable font bytes and compiles a
glyph's outline on first use, caching it, instead of parsing every glyph when the font is
constructed. Constructing a font therefore costs no outline work, which keeps the browser
display worker responsive when a face is promoted after first paint. The rasterizer is
otherwise unchanged, and the crate's tests pin metrics and bitmap hashes against upstream
Fontdue 0.9.4. [PATCH.md](PATCH.md) names the changed files and tests.

Move this crate with `packages/term-wasm` and the lockfile.

The upstream README follows unchanged.

# Fontdue

Fontdue is a simple, `no_std` (does not use the standard library for portability), pure Rust, TrueType (`.ttf/.ttc`) & OpenType (`.otf`) font rasterizer and layout tool. It strives to make interacting with fonts as fast as possible, and currently has the lowest end to end latency for a font rasterizer.

## Roadmap
`fontdue` is designed to be a replacement for `rusttype` [(link)](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/rusttype), `ab_glyph` [(link)](https://github.com/alexheretic/ab-glyph), parts of `glyph_brush` [(link)](https://github.com/alexheretic/glyph-brush/tree/master/glyph-brush), and `glyph_brush_layout` [(link)](https://github.com/alexheretic/glyph-brush/tree/master/layout). This is a class of font libraries that don't tackle shaping.

It's unlikely I'll have time to integrate with a shaping library. If you need a more complete font engine you should check out the wonderful [Cosmic Text](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text) project, which is a very complete pure rust text library.

This Merkur copy validates and retains owned font bytes at creation, then compiles and caches each glyph outline on first use. It still allocates and depends on the `alloc` crate. The font structures have no lifetime dependencies. See [PATCH.md](PATCH.md) for the local change and reference tests; the rasterizer is unchanged.

## Example

[Live demo](https://mooman219.github.io/fontdue/). This demo is a web-assembly build of `fontdue` rasterizing to a browser canvas. It provides a side by side of characters being rasterized between `fontdue` and the browser's canvas text api provided with the same parameters.

Some other examples can be found under ./dev/examples.

### Rasterization
The rasterization API should not see major changes in the near future.
```rust
// Read the font data.
let font = include_bytes!("../resources/Roboto-Regular.ttf") as &[u8];
// Parse it into the font type.
let font = fontdue::Font::from_bytes(font, fontdue::FontSettings::default()).unwrap();
// Rasterize and get the layout metrics for the letter 'g' at 17px.
let (metrics, bitmap) = font.rasterize('g', 17.0);
```

### Layout
The layout API is immature and may see breaking changes. The layout `fontdue` provides is naïve and is only designed to be on par with existing libraries like `glyph_brush`.
```rust
// Read the font data.
let font = include_bytes!("../resources/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf") as &[u8];
// Parse it into the font type.
let roboto_regular = Font::from_bytes(font, fontdue::FontSettings::default()).unwrap();
// The list of fonts that will be used during layout.
let fonts = &[roboto_regular];
// Create a layout context. Laying out text needs some heap allocations; reusing this context
// reduces the need to reallocate space. We inform layout of which way the Y axis points here.
let mut layout = Layout::new(CoordinateSystem::PositiveYUp);
// By default, layout is initialized with the default layout settings. This call is redundant, but
// demonstrates setting the value with your custom settings.
layout.reset(&LayoutSettings {
    ..LayoutSettings::default()
});
// The text that will be laid out, its size, and the index of the font in the font list to use for
// that section of text.
layout.append(fonts, &TextStyle::new("Hello ", 35.0, 0));
layout.append(fonts, &TextStyle::new("world!", 40.0, 0));
// Prints the layout for "Hello world!"
println!("{:?}", layout.glyphs());

// If you wanted to attached metadata based on the TextStyle to the glyphs returned in the
// glyphs() function, you can use the TextStyle::with_metadata function. In this example, the
// Layout type is now parameterized with u8 (Layout<u8>). All styles need to share the same
// metadata type.
let mut layout = Layout::new(CoordinateSystem::PositiveYUp);
layout.append(fonts, &TextStyle::with_user_data("Hello ", 35.0, 0, 10u8));
layout.append(fonts, &TextStyle::with_user_data("world!", 40.0, 0, 20u8));
println!("{:?}", layout.glyphs());
```

## Performance

### Rasterization

These benchmarks measure the time it takes to generate the glyph metrics and bitmap for the text "Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow." over a range of sizes. The lower the line in the graph the better.

### Layout

This benchmark measures the time it takes to layout latin characters of sample text with wrapping on word boundaries.

## Notices

### Maintenance

Please bear with me on new features or quirks that you find. Bugs will take priority, but I don't have as much time as I would like to work on fontdue so please be patient, this is a solo project.

### TrueType & OpenType Table Support

Fontdue depends on `ttf-parser` ([link](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/ttf-parser)) for parsing fonts, which supports a wide range of TrueType and OpenType features.

### Attribution

`Fontdue` started as a vaguely more production ready fork of `font-rs` [(link)](https://github.com/raphlinus/font-rs) because of how fast it made rasterization look, and how simple the `rusttype` [(link)](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/rusttype) crate made font parsing look. Since then, I've read a lot of font specification and modern rasterization techniques, rewriting `fontdue` from the ground up in the process into its own unique beast.
